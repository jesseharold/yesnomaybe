You can save your work by downloading your data to a plain text file (`ynm-[numbers].txt`) that is not human-readable, so you don't have to worry about someone seeing it on your computer. Retrieve your work by opening the the file in a plain text editor (not Word) and pasting it into the upload box on the app. This app does not store, retain, or use your list, or your personal data in *any way*. The app is hosted on Netlify, so you can also take a look at their [privacy policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/) to see what data they may collect. Unless you are a registered user with Netlify, it will likely be anonymous, but feel free to read and determine for yourself.

Share your YNM list with someone by printing it out, saving it as a PDF, or sending someone your ynm.text file, which they can upload into the app and look at. (PDF printing tip: make sure you have background colors turned on in your print settings, or it won't look as nice).
